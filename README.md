## [Cyclistic.](https://github.com/Roccodrilosky/Cyclistic-BI/blob/main/README.md)

Cyclistic is a fictional bike-share company in New York City.  
Cyclistic has partnered with the city of New York to provide shared bikes. Currently, there are bike stations located throughout Manhattan and neighboring boroughs. Customers are able to rent bikes for easy travel between stations at these locations.

Cyclistic’s Customer Growth Team is creating a business plan for next year. The team wants to understand how their customers are using their bikes; their top priority is identifying customer demand at different station locations.

Cyclistic has captured data points for every trip taken by their customers, including:

- Trip start time and location (station number, and its latitude/longitude)
- Trip end time and location (station number, and its latitude/longitude)
- The rented bike’s identification number
- The type of customer (either a one-time customer, or a subscriber)

The dataset includes millions of rides, so the team wants a dashboard that summarizes key insights. Business plans that are driven by customer insights are more successful than plans driven by just internal staff observations.

## [Google Fiber.](https://github.com/Roccodrilosky/GoogleFiber-BI/blob/main/README.md)

Google Fiber is a company that provides fiber optic internet to people and businesses.
The team needs to understand how often customers  phone customer support again after their first inquiry; this will help leaders understand whether the team is able to answer customer questions the first time. Further, leaders want to explore trends in repeat calls to identify why customers are having to call more than once, as well as how to improve the overall customer experience. I will create a dashboard to reveal insights about repeat callers. 

This fictional dataset is a version of actual data the team works with. Because of this, the data is already anonymized and approved. It includes:

- Number of calls
- Number of repeat calls after first contact
- Call type
- Market city
- Date
